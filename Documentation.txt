How does this work?

This is a question most of you may be asking. 

Well, the script itself uses OPenAI's GPT model(s) in order to get just about every piece of information available. HUGE credits to them.

I combined the GPT and its power into prompts. In the code, you can see something like:

generate("Write an adventurous two sentences about being" + command + " in second person point of view")

I basically gave prompts to the GPT. (I was surprised at how well it worked, it was pretty amazing).

And that is why you should try it too! But before you do that, make sure to get an API key from openAI! Otherwise this will not work.
