How does this work?

This is a question most of you may be asking. 

Well, the script itself uses chat GPT-3, open AI's well-known Ai for getting just about every piece of information available. HUGE credits to them.

I combined ChatGPT-3's power into prompts. In the code, you can see something like:

generate("Write an adventurous two sentences about being" + command + " in second person point of view")

I basically gave prompts to the Chat GPT-3. I was surprised at how WELL it worked. It was pretty amazing.

And that is why you should try it too! But before you do that, make sure to get an API key from openAI! Otherwise this will not work.
