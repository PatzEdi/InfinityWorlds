Welcome to Infinity Worlds!

This is a fun little project I had always wanted to make. 

I always wanted to make my own version of these text-based adventures and share it to everyone, especially now that most people have access to OpenAi's api keys.

In this game, you enter a world of infinite possibilities. More information on that on the README file.

I am hoping this will bring fun and adventure to your free time. It is created with passion by PatzEdi.

Please note, I am doing this for fun purposes and to test out the capabilities of openAi's Chat GPT-3. HUGE credits to them and what they have done. They are the reason this project exists.

Created an issue on GitHub if you have concerns about this project, and what I can improve! We are all learning here!

Please, share this project around if you would like to. It helps a lot!

Thanks!!
