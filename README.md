# InfinityWorlds
Welcome to InfinityWorlds, a text-based adventure with infinite possibilities, made with the power of Chat GPT-3.

## **IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
**Due to some changes made at OpenAI and the introduction of Chat GPT-4, InfinityWorlds will most likely be revised and made better with more features and it being easier to use overall. If you experience any errors with the current version, stay tuned for the possibly upcoming major update. Note that this will take a while depending on when OpenAi actually releases their API to developers in the hopefully near future: [API Waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api) Thanks for the support as always!**

DISCLAIMER: You NEED an OpenAI API Key to make this work! You can get one at:  https://openai.com/api/ 

HUGE Credits to the OpenAI team for Chat GPT-3 and to Shields.io for the badges on the README.md!

*You need to paste the API key at the top of the InfinityWorlds.py where it says "openAiapikey". Put it in between the two single quotes, and you will be good to go!(More instructions below)*

- Paste your API key in between the two single quotes in the code:
```
openAiapikey = '' #Paste your code in between these two apostrophes
```

## **Written in python, made with OpenAI's Chat GPT-3 and passion. Welcome to the Infinity Worlds.**

## **Features**
- An infinite amount of possibilities - yes, literally.
- Make any story you want
- Includes "flashbacks" meaning that the AI can make connections from previous parts of the story to the present. This means that it can memorize names, places, etc in the story and make connections with other parts of the story later on.
- Privacy-friendly
- Write "QQT" in the "what happens next?" and you will exit the game.
- Easy to use.
- Want to make your imagination come true? Infinity Worlds is the right thing for you.
- Fast and efficient, includes animations.

## **Why?**
- I wanted to showcase how one can easily use the power of chat GPT-3 made from OpenAI to make something special. 
- I loved the concept of other apps such as AI Dungeon. They were great. But then... it became worse overtime. So I decided to remake my version, from scratch! Was it worth it? Totally. Especially because I did this in order to figure out on my own how they actually did this through the process of doing it on my own, it is super interesting.
____________________________________________________________________________
## **How?**
- I "fed" the AI prompts that I created on my own. For example, I told it to write about the inputted sentences the user put in, continue the story, and most importantly, write it in second person POV.
- You may be asking, does this Infinity Worlds project actually memorize what is happening and what happened in the past of the story? Yes! It does! And I did this by creating a list and appending all of the information of the story into the list and then feeding the AI with that list plus the new information given by the user. It works perfectly, and it is a great way for the AI to look back on things such as names, places, and the story's history in general from any point in the story!
- OpenAI and their GPT-3 AI Model is super impressive. They made this and other projects come to life, just like your imagination will when you play this!

## **User notice**
- Unfortunately, I can not provide ONE API key for the script and for everyone. This is why you need to:
- GET YOUR OWN API KEY FROM: https://openai.com/api/
- This project is a project I made for fun for myself, and now for others.
- Regarding updates, I will update this "game" frequently. I have already thought of adding some more features that will make the experience a lot better. That said, it is still in its pretty much very early stages, but it works great!
